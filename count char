file. The character can be read from the user through keyboard. You can use srm.txt as
the input file.

CODE:
class Main
{
public static int count(String s, char c)
{
int res = 0;

for (int i=0; i&lt;s.length(); i++)
{
// checking character in string
if (s.charAt(i) == c)
res++;
}
return res;
}

// Driver method
public static void main(String args[])
{
String str= &quot;SRM University, Andhra Pradesh, also known as SRM University, Amaravati, is a
private university located near Neerukonda village in Mangalagiri mandal of Guntur district in
